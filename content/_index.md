### Course Structure

#### Labs
Students will work in groups of 4-5 to complete labs which guide them through the exploration of a topic. Labs will focus on open-ended computational problem solving where students will go through the process of defining a problem, writing pseudocode to solve that problem, translating that pseudocode to Python code, and testing and debugging that code. In most situations, students will not be expected to finish all parts of a lab, but instead will work through as much of the lab as they can (and can continue working on the lab after the session ends if they choose).

#### Check-in Quizzes
At the end of each session, students will complete a check-in quiz to help them reflect on the concepts and skills covered that day and to check their understanding of the material. Quiz results will be used to determine what content should be reviewed at the beginning of the following day.

#### Project
Students will spend 2-3 days completing a larger coding project that draws on the Python constructs they learned in the bootcamp. For this project, students will create a short animation using the Python turtle package that can be transformed into a GIF. The nature of this project will require students to demonstrate their understanding of decomposition and abstraction in order to effectively and efficiently create an animation. Additionally, though this project will not be formally assessed, students will be provided with a list of suggested Python constructs to include in their project. After completing their projects, students will share their works with their peers in a virtual art show where students will be able to act as art critics as they (constructively) critique the works of their peers.

#### Getting Help
During class sessions, students are encouraged to first seek out their group mates when they are stuck or confused. Additionally, the instructor and the TA will move between small groups
to answer questions and provide problem solving guidance. A virtual help queue will be provided so that groups can sign up for support from a teacher. Halfway through each class, the entire class will gather to discuss common confusions and bugs.

Office hours will be held each weekday from 3-4pm PST. During this time, students can attend to ask questions, review topics, and get support on their projects or unfinished sections of labs.

#### Programming Environment
The course used Python3 with the Jupyter Notebook IDE. Check out the [setup page]({{< relref "setup" >}}) for help getting started.

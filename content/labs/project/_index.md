# Project
You did it! You've made it to the end of the course. All that's left is creating
a project that combines your new Python knowledge into a Turtle drawing.

## Cloning the project
You can get started on the project just like you got started on the labs: by cloning
a repository condtianing some starter code.


{{< code-action >}} Clone the directory for the project into your `mims_bootcamp`
directory:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/wolfj95/mims-project.git
```

## Completing the project
The project is intentionally open-ended. The only instructions are to make an
animation using the Python Turtle. However, you will probably find the most
success by taking some time to plan out the animation that you make first.

Inside the Jupyter notebook, you'll find some tips for getting started on the planning
of this project.

After you've made a solid plan, you can get started coding. We suggest you place
your high level animation code in the Jupyter notebook (`project.ipynb`) and your lower
level functions in the `parts.py` file, just like we saw in the animation lab.


{{< aside >}}
Unfortunately, the Colab Turtle is unable to run animations. If you have been working on Colab,
you can alternatively make a more complicated Turtle drawing that you could use for an animation
once you get Jupyter notebooks running.

# Loops Lab
In this lab, we will learn how to make the computer do the same instruction over and over. 
This is very useful in solving computational problems with your computer like sorting
through large amounts of data or performing the same actions for many users. However, repetition
is also a feature of natural processes. In this lab, you'll explore how repetitions and the
patterns they create appear in plants.
